- Strict Mode by default.
- OpenSpec by default.
- `br` always for task tracking.
- `mise` always for tools/tasks/envs.
- `sg` for code search, not plain grep.
- `sem diff` whenever possible for review.
- GitButler instead of `jj`.

## Conditional reminders

These blocks sharpen task-specific behavior. `AGENTS.md` remains the source of
truth if anything here is incomplete.

<important if="you are starting work, planning, or updating specs">
- OpenSpec first unless the human explicitly says `Full Yolo`.
- Encode execution order and dependencies in `br` before implementation.
- Default to Strict Mode and bounded fan-out.
</important>

<important if="you are writing or modifying code">
- Use TDD: red -> green -> refactor.
- Start with clear names, interfaces, and docstrings that fit repo conventions.
- Use smaller subagents on separable workstreams.
</important>

<important if="you are writing or modifying tests">
- Test real behavior, not mocked behavior under test.
- Aim for unit, integration, and end-to-end coverage on touched behavior.
- Clean logs and deterministic output are part of passing.
</important>

<important if="you are reviewing, verifying, or handing off work">
- Prefer `sem diff` over plain text diffs when possible.
- Run compressed verification during iteration and full verification before handoff.
- Report the actual verification state, not the intended one.
</important>

<important if="you are touching branches, commits, or git status">
- Use `but`, not `git` or `jj`, for repo version-control workflows.
- Hidden tool directories can churn during normal operation; confirm before escalating routine `.beads/`, `.entire/`, `.trunk/`, `.mise/`, or `.tools/` changes.
- Never bypass hooks or rewrite history without explicit approval.
</important>

## Preferred Execution Order

1. understand intent
2. update OpenSpec (unless Full Yolo)
3. create/update `br` tasks and dependencies
4. plan and parallelize
5. fan out bounded work to smaller models/subagents
6. TDD red -> green -> refactor
7. run compressed verification during iteration
8. run full verification before handoff

## Mode Rules

### Strict Mode

- Human approval before implementation.
- Full spec discipline.
- Full TDD and verification discipline.

### Yolo Mode

- Must be explicitly requested.
- Keeps `br`, TDD, and verification.
- Reduces ceremony, not quality.

### Full Yolo

- Must be explicitly requested by name.
- May skip OpenSpec.
- Still keeps `br`, tests, and verification.

## Tool Quick Reference

### `br`

- `br ready` — find unblocked work
- `br create "..."` — create task
- `br show <id>` — inspect task
- `br update <id> --status in_progress` — claim work
- `br dep add <issue> <depends-on>` — encode dependency
- `br close <id>` — close task
- `br sync --flush-only` — export bead data

### `bv`

- Use to inspect graph shape, blockers, and the critical path.

### OpenSpec

- Use first for spec-driven work unless in Full Yolo.

### `sem`

- Prefer `sem diff` over `git diff` for code review.

### `sg`

- Use for code search and structural rewrites.
- Only use plain-text grep for docs, logs, and prose.

### `mise`

- `mise install` — sync toolchain
- `mise run <task>` — run project task
- `mise tasks ls` — inspect available tasks

### `linctl`

- Use for human/team reporting and Linear workflows.
- Do not use it as a replacement for `br`.

### `entire`

- `entire enable` at project start if not already enabled.

### GitButler

- Preferred branch orchestration model here.
- No `jj` workspaces, rebases, or parallelize flows.

## Workspace Hygiene

- dependency changes
- CI/release changes
- security/auth changes
- migrations or data-shape changes
- destructive git actions
- weakening test or review gates

## Planning Helpers

- If `agent-brief` or `robots` exists in the active harness, use them for deeper planning and fan-out.
- If they do not exist, proceed with the repo workflow above.
